Database Upgrade and Downgrade Workflow
The application is in its infancy at this point, but it does not hurt to discuss what is going to be the database migration strategy going forward. 
Imagine that you have your application on your development machine, and also have a copy deployed to a production server that is online and in use.

Let's say that for the next release of your app you have to introduce a change to your models, for example a new table needs to be added. 
Without migrations you would need to figure out how to change the schema of your database, both in your development machine and then again in your server, 
and this could be a lot of work.

But with database migration support, after you modify the models in your application you generate a new migration script (flask db migrate), 
you probably review it to make sure the automatic generation did the right thing, and then apply the changes to your development database (flask db upgrade). 
You will add the migration script to source control and commit it.

When you are ready to release the new version of the application to your production server, all you need to do is grab the updated version of your application, 
which will include the new migration script, and run flask db upgrade. Alembic will detect that the production database is not updated to the latest revision of the schema, 
and run all the new migration scripts that were created after the previous release.

As I mentioned earlier, you also have a flask db downgrade command, which undoes the last migration. While you will be unlikely to need this option on a production system, 
you may find it very useful during development. You may have generated a migration script and applied it, only to find that the changes that you made are not exactly what you need. 
In this case, you can downgrade the database, delete the migration script, and then generate a new one to replace it.
